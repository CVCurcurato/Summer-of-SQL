-- Reshape the data so we have 5 rows for each customer, with responses for the Mobile App and Online Interface being in separate fields on the same row
-- Clean the question categories so they don't have the platform in from of them
--     - e.g. Mobile App - Ease of Use should be simply Ease of Use
-- Exclude the Overall Ratings, these were incorrectly calculated by the system
-- Calculate the Average Ratings for each platform for each customer 
-- Calculate the difference in Average Rating between Mobile App and Online Interface for each customer
-- Catergorise customers as being:
--     - Mobile App Superfans if the difference is greater than or equal to 2 in the Mobile App's favour
--     - Mobile App Fans if difference >= 1
--     - Online Interface Fan
--     - Online Interface Superfan
--     - Neutral if difference is between 0 and 1
-- Calculate the Percent of Total customers in each category, rounded to 1 decimal place
